Chicken tikka masala is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken chunks (chicken tikka) in spiced curry sauce. The curry is usually creamy and orange-coloured. There are differing theories regarding the geographic origin of the dish, broadly split between those attributing it to cooks from South Asia living in Great Britain, and those that view it as first created on the Indian subcontinent. The dish is offered at restaurants around the world and was described by former UK foreign secretary Robin Cook as "a true British national dish."
